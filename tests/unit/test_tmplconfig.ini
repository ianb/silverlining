[general]
# Just naming the general setup:
name = my-server-setup
# This is used for filling in node names if they aren't explicitly given:
base_domain = foobar.com
# If you set this to false, then /etc/hosts won't be updated:
set_etc_hosts = false

[provider]
# You can just look up a provider in ~/.silverlining.conf:
name = whatever
# Or specify all the values:
provider = rackspace
username = foobar
secret = XXX
# or:
secret_file = {{environ.FAKE_HOME}}/.rackspace-secret.txt

[appserver]
# This describes the app server
# You can have multiple things setup:
locations =
    http://foobar.com/ APP_NAME1

# You can setup multiple nodes:
nodes = 10
# default being 1, of course.

# You can indicate the size of these nodes too:
size = id 1
# You can also give the size in MB of ram (since that generally
# increments):
size = ram 256MB

# This is used to name the nodes:
node_name = app{{n}}.foobar.com

# If not provided, this will be automatically determined by the
# number of nodes (1=no balancing), and the existence of a
# [balancer] section.
load_balancer = true

[service:mysql]
# How many nodes to assign:
nodes = 1
# Without special support, generally just 1 node is supported
# also node_name/size

[balancer]
# Describes the load balancer
node_name = balancer.foobar.com
hostnames = foobar.com
    baz.com
