Developing toppcloud Itself
===========================

You should read and consider the `design notes <design>`_ of course.

Version Control
---------------

Generally I like to use forks for feature additions, and only use hg
branches for things like a stable branch.  So if you want to add a
feature, you should fork/clone the repository and make those changes.
I appreciate some note (in the description field) about what your
fork's purpose is.  It might simply be "to mess around with
toppcloud", but I still appreciate the note.

The main repository is for integration.  I'm not shy about giving out
write access to this repository, if you are making consistent
contributions it's easier for both of us if you can simply push
directly to the main branch.  This doesn't remove the utility of
forks; if you are doing something that will take a while to complete
or you aren't sure if it's in line with toppcloud's design, it's still
reasonable to do your own fork.
