Documents Wanted
================

Here I list documents that I think should exist, but do not:

* A deployment equivalent to `Development Patterns
  <devpatterns.html>`_ -- outline the typical workflow for deploying
  applications.

* Quickstarts for: Pylons/TurboGears/Repoze (they are all pretty
  similar), and for using SQLAlchemy, CouchDB, and whatever else comes
  along.  (The persistence ones will be small, but I think quite
  helpful for arranging code.)

* How Stuff Works; descriptions of the inner workings of Silver
  Lining.
