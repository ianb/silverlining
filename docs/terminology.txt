toppcloud Terminology
==============================

Provider:
    This is a provider like Rackspace, EC2, etc.  This is generally
    defined in ~/.toppcloud.conf

Node:
    This is a virtual server that has been setup.  It has a name,
    which is also the domain name it can be accessed by.  The name
    doesn't have to be in DNS (/etc/hosts is setup for this).

Hostname:
    This is a running instance of an application.  It lives on some
    Node, and can be deployed to.  Over its life a hostname will have
    many application instances deployed to it.  In most cases once a
    hostname has been assigned to a node, you can use the hostname
    instead of the node name (all toppcloud really cares about is that
    the nodename is a DNS-or-/etc/hosts-resolvable name, so the
    canonical and the per-site host names are interchangeable).

Application:
    This is a codebase that can be run.  It has an app.ini file, and a
    main.py or config.ini file for actually running the application.
    It also has a major version (each major version can be deployed as
    a separate site running concurrently, similarly to App Engine).

Site:
    This is a deployment of an application.  It has a name (used
    internally) and one or more hostnames.  Any persistence is shared
    over all deployments of a site.

Deployment:
    This is a site when it is deployed.  It typically has a name that
    starts with the site name, and looks like
    "site_name.application_version.date" (maybe with numbers appended
    to make the deployment name unique).

Services:
    These are persistent services that the application will use.  The
    only one written so far is postgis, which sets up a postgis
    database.
