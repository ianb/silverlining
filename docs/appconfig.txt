Application Configuration
-------------------------

You application is configured with a file ``app.ini``.  It's really
recommended that you put this file in your source code repository and
symlink it into its location at the root of the app directory.

``app_name``:
    The name of the application, a simple identifier.

``runner``:
    This points to the file that "runs" the application.  This can be
    a ``.py`` file that defines an object ``application``, a WSGI
    application.  It can also be a ``.ini`` file which has an
    ``[app:main]`` section that can be loaded by Paste Deploy (e.g.,
    for a Pylons application).

``update_fetch``:
    This option gives one (or more) URLs that should be fetched
    every time the application is updated.  It is also fetched *every
    time* your development server is started (with ``silver
    serve``).  (Maybe this last bit should be changed.)

    These can setup tables, create directories, etc.  You can check
    ``environ['silverlining.update']`` to be sure this is an internal
    update request.  If you want multiple URLs, put each on its own
    line (in ``.ini`` files you can use indentation on subsequent
    lines to continue a configuration value).

``default_host``:
    This is a default for ``silver update --host``, so you don't
    have to enter that option each time you update.

``service.*``
    The presence of the setting activates the `service <services.html>`_.
    It can have a value, which is passed to the service, but no
    service uses that yet.
