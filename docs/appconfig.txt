Application Configuration
----------------------------------------

You application is configured with a file ``app.ini``.  It's really
recommended that you put this file in your source code repository and
symlink it into its location at the root of the app directory.

``app_name``:
    The name of the application, a simple identifier.

``version``:
    This is the "version" of the application.  You only need to
    increment this for major updates.  When you do so you can (in
    theory) have both the older version and the newer version active,
    only accessing the newer version when you use a version-specific
    URL.

``runner``:
    This points to the file that "runs" the application.  This can be
    a ``.py`` file that defines an object ``application``, a WSGI
    application.  It can also be a ``.ini`` file which has an
    ``[app:main]`` section that can be loaded by Paste Deploy (e.g.,
    for a Pylons application).

``update_fetch``:
    This option configuration is one (or more) URLs that should be
    fetched everytime the application is updated.  It is also fetch
    *every time* your development server is started (with ``toppcloud
    serve``).

    These can setup tables, create directories, etc.  You can check
    ``environ['toppcloud.update']`` to be sure this is an internal
    update request.  If you want multiple URLs, put each on its own
    line (in ``.ini`` files you can use indentation on subsequent
    lines).

``default_host``:
    This is a default for ``toppcloud update --host``, so you don't
    have to enter that option each time you update.

``service.*``
    The presence of the setting activates the `service <services>`_.
    It can have a value, which is passed to the service, but no
    service uses that yet.
