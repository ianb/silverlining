 Disabling Sites
=================

When hosting a site it's likely that from time to time it will be
necessary to make it unavailable to the general public while some
maintenance is carried out.  Silver Lining provides a mechanism for
allowing this.  It is important to recognise that it is *applications*
that are disabled via this mechanism, rather than locations, so if the
same application is accessible via two different locations (even if it
is two different *deployments* of the application), and it is
disabled, then it will appear to be disabled at both locations.  This
is because if your application uses a database, then all different
deployments of the application will share the database, and cleaning
up databases is one of the key use-cases for this feature.

Disabling an application
========================

The following command will disable an application called blog::

    $ silver disable --by-name blog

You can also disable the application by giving a path that it appears
at::

    silver disable --by-location www.example.com/blog

Enabling an application
=======================

To re-enable an application you use the ``silver enable`` command,
which takes the same options as silver disable command.

The disabled special location
=============================
When an application is disabled, visitors to it will be shown a page
explaining that the site is unavailable (similarly there is a
not-found location which is shown when a URL is not resolved).  It is
possible to replace this page by uploading a new WSGI application to
the special location "disabled".  To restore the default application,
use the ``silver activate`` command to point the disabled location to
"default-disabled".

Headers for disabled apps
-------------------------
It is sensible to return a "503 Service Unavailable" response from a
disabled app and use the following headers:

:Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, max-age=0
:Pragma: no-cache

Access To disabled apps
=======================
While an application is disabled, it is still possible to access it
via the command line tools.  ``silver backup``, ``restore``, ``run``
etc. will all work as usual.  It's also possible to access the site
through a web browser.  At present the application is only made
available to clients connecting from localhost, so to view the site
and access management facilities you will probably need to set up an
SSH tunnel and manually update ``/etc/hosts`` on your own machine.
