Management Scripts
==================

Let's say you want to write a script to do an import or some other
management task.  This is nice and easy to do locally during
development, but then if you want to use that command in production
this is harder.  A typical example is a script to import raw data.

Silver Lining has support for running commands on applications, as
though they were local applications.  It looks like this::

     $ cd myapp-app
     $ silver run import-script --setting=value ~/import-data.zip

``silver run`` takes as an argument the name of the script to run;
this should be a script in the ``bin/`` directory (in this example
``myapp-app/bin``) that has been uploaded to the server.  If you edit
the file locally and don't do ``silver update`` remember that it will
use the old version of the script.

The script must be a Python script.  The path will be appropriately
setup so all your libraries will be ready, and environmental variables
set, and then the script will be run, passing all arguments you
provide to the script.

Also any arguments that you pass that point to a file or directory
that exists will cause those files to be uploaded, and the remote
filenames will be substituted.  So in the example
``~/import-data.zip`` will be uploaded to the server.

Note that these scripts can be run as ``www-data`` (the default) or
you can use ``--user=www-mgr`` to run the script as ``www-mgr`` (the
normal user used to manage the deployment of scripts) or
``--user=root`` to run the script as ``root``.
