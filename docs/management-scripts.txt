Management Scripts
==================

Let's say you want to write a script to do an import or some other
management task.  This is nice and easy to do locally during
development, but then if you want to use that command in production
this is harder.  A typical example is a script to import raw data.

toppcloud has support for running commands on applications, as though
they were local applications.  It looks like this::

     $ cd myapp-app
     $ toppcloud run import-script --setting=value ~/import-data.zip

``toppcloud run`` takes as an argument the name of the script to run;
this should be a script in the ``bin/`` directory (in this example
``myapp-app/bin``) that has been uploaded to the server.  If you edit
the file locally and don't do ``toppcloud update`` remember that it
will use the old version of the script.

The script must be a Python script.  The path will be appropriate
setup and then the script will be run, passing all arguments you
provide to the script.

Also any arguments that you pass that point to a file or directory
that exists will cause those files to be uploaded, and the remote
filenames will be substituted.  So in the example
``~/import-data.zip`` will be uploaded to the server.
