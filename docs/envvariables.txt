Environmental Variables
=======================

This document describes all the environmental variables that Silver
Lining creates, that an application might want to use (or just might
notice).

``SILVER_VERSION``:

    This gives the version in the form ``context/version``, like
    ``silverlining/0.0`` or ``devel/0.0``.  Having not had a release,
    there is no real version information yet, but this can be used to
    detect the difference between production and development
    environments.  (Also ``silversupport.env.is_production()`` does
    this.)

``SILVER_INSTANCE_NAME``:

    This is the name of the instance/deployment.

``SILVER_MATCH_PATH``:

    This is the portion of the path that was matched during dispatch.
    For instance if you upload an app to ``site.example.com/blog``
    then ``SILVER_MATCH_PATH`` will be ``/blog``.

``SILVER_APP_NAME``:

    This is the name of the application.  If ``SILVER_INSTANCE_NAME`` is
    ``blog.20100319_004`` then this will probably be ``blog``.

``CONFIG_*``:

    This is the naming convention for all the information coming from
    services.
