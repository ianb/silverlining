File Layout
===========

This document describes how files are laid out in the Silver Lining
code base, and on production servers (and how the two relate).

General Patterns
----------------

Anything that is a "script" (a file meant to be executed) generally
has a ``-`` in the name somewhere, to help indicate that it is *not* a
module (since you cannot import names with dashes).

The Silver Lining Code Base
---------------------------

Here are some notable features:

* The ``silverlining`` package is basically for *managing* the
  process.  It is *not* installed on the production servers, nor is it
  generally importable by applications (nor is there anything worth
  importing).

* The ``silversupport`` is uploaded to the production server, and also
  used locally.  Applications may find it useful to import some
  routines from this library.  There's also simply pieces here that
  both ``silverlining`` and server management scripts need to use, and
  this is the one shared codebase for that.

* ``silversupport`` gets uploaded to
  ``/usr/local/share/silverlining/lib`` (this directory is added to
  ``sys.path`` to make it importable).

* There are a bunch of scripts that are run *on the server*.  Lots of
  what Silver Lining does is just ``ssh server "command"``, with the
  actual code on the server.  All Silver Linings scripts are uploaded
  *from* ``silverlining/mgr-scripts/`` to
  ``/usr/local/share/silverlining/mgr-scripts/``.  These are *only*
  run on the server, not locally.  Each script also adds
  ``/usr/local/share/silverlining/lib`` to its path at the top of the
  script.

* Files in ``silverlining/server-files/`` are rsync'd to the server's
  root.  That is, the file layout under that directory matches the
  server layout exactly.  ``silversupport`` and ``mgr-scripts`` are
  rsync'd separately.

* Some of the files used for *setting up* a server are in
  ``silverlining/server-sync-scripts/``.  This includes the *very
  important* ``update-from-server.sh`` script, which does most of the
  configuration of servers.  If there's anything that needs to be done
  (or checked, or fixed) every time a server is created or updated,
  that's probably the place to look.  (Per-service tasks, like
  installing a database configuration file, go in the service code.)

Services
--------

Services are modules in ``silversupport.services.*``, named after the
service.  Resource files for services go in that package as well (for
instance, the ``pg_hba.conf`` that the postgis service uses is in
``silversupport/services/postgis-pg_hba.conf``).

Server Files
------------

The files created by ``silver setup-node`` are generally put in
``/usr/local/share/silverlining/``.

Configuration files get put wherever they belong, e.g.,
``/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/wsgi_runner``.

Log files go in ``/var/log/silverlining/``.

(Per-application log files, and other kinds of logs, still need to be
filled out better.)
