DNS Services
------------

toppcloud currently does not handle DNS at all.  But it might be nice
if it did, no?  With this in mind I've asked around a bit about DNS
services that include APIs.  So far:

* Slicehost offers something, not sure if you need to sign up for an
  account.

* Rackspace Cloud has something, but I haven't seen an API for it.

* `DNS Made Easy <http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/s0306/res/ddnsc.html>`_

* `Nettica <http://www.nettica.com/Support/Developers.aspx>`_

* `Zerigo <http://www.zerigo.com/managed-dns>`_ (they have a slick Web
  2.1-looking website)
