toppcloud Services
------------------

This document answers the question: what does toppcloud do, and what
does my app do?

The items listed here are things toppcloud does *for* you, and so you
shouldn't do them for yourself.

TOPPCLOUD environmental variable
================================

To see if you are running in a toppcloud production environment, check
``os.environ.get('TOPPCLOUD')``.

Secrets
=======

If you need a "secret", get it like::

    from tcsupport.secret import get_secret
    secret = get_secret()

This is a stable, ASCII secret.

Temporary files
===============

Just kidding; there is no support for temporary files!  This is just a
reminder to use the ``tempfile`` module like usual; it works fine.

Persistence
===========

All persistence gets handled in some fashion by toppcloud.  This is
just so toppcloud knows about it, and so that your app handles what it
should.

Files
~~~~~

*Persistent* files need to be handled by toppcloud.  In your
``app.ini`` put::

    service.files =

That line enables the service.  Then put all your files in
``os.environ['FILES']``.

You only get *one* location for files for your entire app, so it's
recommended you use additional directories under this location for
different kinds of files (even if to start you can only think of one
kind of file).

PostGIS
~~~~~~~

For PostGIS (PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extensions) do::

    service.postgis =

Then look for these environmental variables:

``PG_DBNAME``: 
    The database name.

``PG_USERNAME``: 
    The username to connect as.

``PG_PASSWORD``: 
    The password to use (an empty string means no password is required).

``PG_HOST``: 
    The host (or host:port) to connect to; an empty string means
    localhost.

Right now it's all local, and there won't be any password or host, but
in the future that might change.

CouchDB
~~~~~~~

For CouchDB do::

    service.couchdb =

Then look for::

``COUCHDB_DB``:
    The name of the database to connect to.

``COUCHDB_HOST``:
    The host:port to connect to.
